1. AN HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT.

    _ SECTION I. That from the Norman Conqueſt, to this preſent time, there was an Original Compact or Eſtabliſhment of Laws, by which the Kings of England were to Govern, and the People to be governed.

    _ SECT. II. That they thought it abſolutely neceſſary, that whoſoever would be their King, ſhould make this Compact with them, and be as much obliged by Oath to grant theſe Priviledges to them, as they were to ſwear Allegiance to him.

    _ SECT. III. That when the ancient Laws of their Country were wholly violated, they conſtantly complain'd of the Injuſtice of the Action, required the obſervation of them; and when they could not prevail by fair means, they ſought to recover their Right by Arms. Where an account is given of the Barons Wars for the preſerving of the Magna Charta, and the Charta de Foreſtis.

    _ SECT. IV. That we find throughout the Hiſtory of our Kings, that their Election, or elſe their Compact with the People, hath generally been conceived a thing proper to ſtrengthen their Title to the Crown, or at the leaſt to ſatisfie their People.

    _ SECT. V. That we find mention in Hiſtory of divers Acts of Parliament, or of the Nobles of the Kingdom, continuing the Name and Honour of a King to him, who, by their own confeſſion, had not the immediate Title to the Kingdom, and only Proclaiming him, who had the Right by Proximity of Bloud, Heir Apparent to the Crown.

    _ SECT. VI. The Inferences from the Reſolutions of the beſt Caſuiſts, to prove that the Oath of Allegiance, and of the Coronation, are reciprocal; and conſequently that the obligation of the Oath of Allegiance doth ceaſe, when the Original Compact is Fundamentally violated.
